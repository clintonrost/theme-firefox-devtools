# Firefox DevTools Theme - clintonrost edition

## Description

*Firefox DevTools Theme* is a dark Visual Studio Theme inspired by the fine work of the folks at Mozilla.

I started by using the colors from the resources below and modified them to work together as a whole.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools
- https://github.com/FirefoxUX/icons
- https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/color.html

## Note:
Currently dark theme only.
